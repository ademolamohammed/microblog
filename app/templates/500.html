<!--
upon installing flask-bootstrap, a bootstrap/base.html template
becomes available.

bootstrap/base.html will provide the basic structure of the page,
which includes bootstrap framework files, and provides some blocks
such as title, navbar and content in the derived templates.

We shall use base.html to derive or inherit from bootstrap/base.html and provide
implementatns for the title, navbar and content blocks. In this way,
base.html can export its own app_content block for the derived templates
to define the page content.
